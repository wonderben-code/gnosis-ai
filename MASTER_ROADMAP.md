#### CHECKPOINT OMEGA — SUPERSEDED BY CONVERGENCE CODEX

Original idea was a "potential future use" of Gnosis AI. Now realised as Stage 3b: The Convergence Codex.

---

### Stage 3b: THE CONVERGENCE CODEX — IN PROGRESS

**Repo:** `wonderben-code/convergence-codex` (PUBLIC, MIT, Bitcoin-timestamped)
**Full architecture:** `convergence-codex/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ← THE CANONICAL DOC
**Local:** `/Users/ekramalam/convergence-codex/`

The world's first and largest systematic mapping of cross-domain structural relationships across established science, mathematics, and physics. Three custom AIs form a pipeline: **Gnosis** (discovery) → **Logos** (formalisation) → **Synthesis** (communication).

#### The Multi-Level Recursive Architecture

Not just pairwise comparisons — combinatorial at EVERY level:

**Level 1: ALL field convergences**
- Within-category pairs (~225, 7% of space)
- Cross-category pairs (~2,935, 93% — THIS IS WHERE THE SERIOUS DISCOVERIES ARE)
- Multi-field groups (3+ fields simultaneously, gated by pairwise results)

**Level 2: Meta-convergences (combinatorial across groupings)**
- Multiple grouping strategies on Level 1 output
- Pairwise comparison of convergences themselves
- Cross-level comparisons (Level 1 ↔ Level 2)

**Level 3+: Recursive cascade to fixed points**
- Same combinatorial process applied recursively
- Continue until fixed points or diminishing returns

#### COMPENDIUM NOTE: The Validation Chain

The compendium is NOT just 256 individual theorems. It is a **validation chain** — each layer proves not just mathematical content but validates the METHODOLOGY that produced it.

**Background:** The 256 formalisations came from Gnosis AI's cascade process: 266 pairwise convergences → 26 meta-findings → ~6 themes → 2 terminal fixed points. Some of the 256 formalisations ARE meta-convergences and fixed-point characterisations — they exist at different levels of the cascade. The cascade structure is KNOWN (Gnosis already mapped it). We are PROVING what Gnosis found, not rediscovering it.

---

**THE 5 STEPS (do these in order):**

---

**Step 2a: Prove all 256 individual convergences**

This is the bulk of the work. For each of the 256 convergences Gnosis discovered, write up and verify the formalisation three ways:
- (a) Verbally / in plain language: what the convergence IS
- (b) Mathematically: propositions, proof sketches, formal definitions
- (c) Machine-verified: Lean 4 proof where possible

Each entry includes: confidence score, adversarial verdict, domain pair.

**Example:** "Convergence #47: Topology and QM both exhibit fixed-point convergence under iterated constraint. Proposition: [formal statement]. Lean proof: [file]. Confidence: 0.82. Adversarial verdict: SUPPORTED."

**What completing this step proves:** Every verified convergence proves Gnosis found something REAL — a genuine mathematical relationship, not a hallucination. The verification rate (what % of 256 are machine-verifiable?) is itself a key metric.

**Clarifying note:** These 256 formalisations exist at DIFFERENT LEVELS of the Gnosis cascade. Some are Level 1 (pairwise field convergences), some are Level 2 (meta-convergences — convergences BETWEEN convergences), and some are near the fixed points. We prove them ALL individually here regardless of level. The structure between them comes in Step 2b.

---

**Step 2b: Prove the cascade transitions (theorems for the relationships)**

Once the individual convergences are proved (Step 2a), prove the CASCADE STEPS themselves. These are the Gnosis-mapped transitions between levels — each one is its own theorem or set of theorems.

Concretely, the Gnosis cascade is: 266 convergences → 26 meta-findings → ~6 themes → 2 fixed points. Each transition is a theorem:

- **Level 1 → Level 2 transitions (~26 theorems):** "These 12 specific convergences (T_03, T_17, T_44...) share deeper structure X, proved by exhibiting the morphisms between them." One theorem per meta-finding, each proving that a GROUP of Level 1 convergences genuinely converge to a common structure.
- **Level 2 → Level 3 transitions (~6 theorems):** "These 4 meta-findings (M_02, M_08, M_14, M_22) share deeper structure Y." Same idea, one level up.
- **Level 3 → Fixed point transitions (~2 theorems):** "These themes converge to fixed point F₁ with property P."

**What this step produces:** ~34 transition theorems (26 + 6 + 2, approximately — depends on actual cascade structure). Each proves that a specific cascade step Gnosis identified is mathematically valid.

**What this proves beyond the maths:** The iterative methodology works. Each transition theorem proves that convergence-of-convergences produces genuine mathematical structure, not pattern-matching artifacts. If Level 1 → Level 2 transitions verify, that alone proves meta-convergence is valid.

**How this differs from Step 2a:** Step 2a proves each OBJECT (individual convergence). Step 2b proves each RELATIONSHIP (how objects combine into higher-order objects). Both are necessary — the Super-Theorem (Step 2c) needs both the nodes AND the edges.

---

**Step 2c: Build the Super-Theorem**

This is the key intellectual contribution. Once all individual proofs (Step 2a) AND all transition proofs (Step 2b) exist, connect them into ONE single mathematical object.

**What the Super-Theorem IS:** A single theorem that contains all 256 objects AND all their relationships AND the cascade AND the fixed points as one connected mathematical statement. Not a summary, not a meta-theorem ABOUT other theorems — the actual unified object.

**How to build it:** We already KNOW the structure from Gnosis. Gnosis mapped: which convergences relate to which meta-findings, which meta-findings converge further, all the way to the 2 terminal fixed points. The cascade map (266 → 26 → ~6 → 2) is the blueprint. So:

1. Take all 256 verified theorems from Step 2a — these become the NODES
2. Take the known Gnosis cascade map — these become the EDGES (morphisms witnessing shared structure between theorems)
3. Prove each edge: "Theorem T_i and Theorem T_j share structure S, exhibited by morphism f_ij" — these are the transition proofs
4. Prove the cascade contracts: the edges compose into meta-convergences that terminate at fixed points
5. Characterise the fixed points formally
6. Express the entire thing as ONE theorem: "There exists a categorical diagram D containing objects {T₁...T₂₅₆} with morphisms {f_ij} such that: (1) each T_i is a verified convergence, (2) the morphisms compose into a cascade terminating at N fixed points, (3) each fixed point is reflexive: F ≅ [F, F], (4) the entire diagram D is itself a reflexive structure"

**Why ONE theorem and not many:** The fixed points COME FROM this structure. They are consequences of how the 256 objects relate. So the fundamental mathematical object is the whole connected structure, not the individual theorems or the fixed points separately. The individual proofs (Step 2a) are components. The transition proofs are internal structure. The fixed points are properties. The Super-Theorem is the thing itself.

**Analogy:** Step 2a gives you 256 puzzle pieces. Step 2b shows you how they connect. Step 2c assembles the completed puzzle — a single object with properties (a picture, a shape) that no individual piece has.

**What completing this step proves:**
- About the maths: A 200+ theorem network across dozens of fields, formalised as ONE coherent categorical object. Comparable in scope to Langlands (formalising relationships between number theory and representation theory) but at 200+ theorem scale across dozens of fields — unprecedented.
- About Gnosis: The iterative meta-convergence methodology produces mathematically valid results. The cascade structure Gnosis found is REAL, not pattern-matching artifacts.
- About the ToE: If the fixed points of this empirical structure are reflexive (F ≅ [F, F]), matching what D∞ ≅ [D∞ → D∞] predicts, then the Generator Theory's structural prediction is confirmed by independently verified cross-domain evidence.

---

**Step 2d: Derive the corollaries (the big claims)**

FROM the Super-Theorem (Step 2c), derive the specific headline results:

1. **The SRRP is a theorem, not a hypothesis.** "The verified mathematical structure of cross-domain convergence IS self-referential relational structure" — proved, not asserted. The fixed points are reflexive. The metaphysical interpretation remains separate, but the mathematical content is established.

2. **The Unified Structure Theorem of Science.** "200+ established results from dozens of independent scientific fields converge to a common reflexive structure via a formally verified cascade." This has never been done. It's a proof — machine-verified — that deep structural unity exists across science.

3. **Validation of the ToE.** If the empirical cascade's fixed points match the Generator construction's predictions, "self-referential relational structure unifies these fields" is evidence for the Generator Theory. The compendium becomes the strongest evidence section of the Grand ToE Paper.

---

**Step 2e: Write the methodology section**

A section WITHIN the compendium that explains how it was built and what the validation chain proves:

- **How it was built:** Gnosis AI (autonomous discovery of cross-domain convergences) → Logos AI (formal mathematical articulation) → Lean 4 (machine verification). The discoveries and formalisations are AI-generated, then machine-verified.
- **The validation chain — what each step proves about the methodology:**
  - Step 2a verified (individual convergences) → Gnosis finds real maths, not hallucinations
  - Step 2b verified (cascade transitions) → iterative meta-convergence methodology is valid
  - Step 2c verified (Super-Theorem) → the full structure is coherent as one mathematical object
  - Step 2d derived (SRRP + Unified Structure Theorem) → the methodology produces deep, unified mathematical structure
- **DEFINE Y (our methodology):** Two novel methodologies we created:
  - (1) **Convergence** — autonomous pairwise structural comparison of independent fields to identify shared formal structure (implemented in Gnosis AI)
  - (2) **Iterative convergence** — applying convergence recursively to its own outputs, producing meta-convergences that cascade to fixed points (implemented in Gnosis AI's cascade mode)
  - Logos AI then formally articulates and machine-verifies what Gnosis discovers.
- **DEFINE X (what Y discovers):** Cross-domain structural unity — that independent mathematical and scientific fields share formal structure which can be autonomously identified, formally stated, and machine-verified. The deeper discovery (from iterative convergence): this shared structure ITSELF has structure — it cascades, contracts, and terminates at reflexive fixed points.
- **THE CLAIM: Y discovered X.** The compendium proves this. Methodologies (1) and (2) discovered cross-domain structural unity, and the compendium's verification chain (Steps 2a–2d) validates that both the discoveries AND the methodologies are mathematically sound. The methodologies are novel, the discoveries are novel, and the compendium is the proof of both.
- **NAME AND DEFINE THE FULL METHODOLOGY (provenance claim):**
  The compendium must define, name, and claim provenance over the ENTIRE possibility space of this type of methodology. Not just the two specific instances we used (pairwise convergence + iterative convergence), but the full generalised framework:

  **The general method (needs a name — define in compendium):**
  1. Find convergences between fields — not just pairwise, but ANY number of fields simultaneously (2-way, 3-way, n-way)
  2. Iterate the convergences toward fixed points — apply the convergence operation recursively to its own outputs at any depth
  3. Apply formal mathematical proof to the objects produced at any stage
  4. **Combinatorial explosion at each level** — at every level of the cascade, you can combinatorially explode: compare all pairs of objects at that level, all triples, all n-tuples. Not just at Level 1 (fields) but at Level 2 (meta-convergences), Level 3 (themes), etc. Each level has its own combinatorial space of possible comparisons.
  5. Any permutation of the above: vary the number of fields compared, the iteration depth, the verification method, the domain selection strategy, the grouping strategy at each level, the comparison arity at each level

  What we actually DID (Gnosis + Logos) is ONE instantiation of this general methodology. The full possibility space includes: different starting field sets, different comparison arities (pairwise, triplewise, n-wise) **at each cascade level independently**, combinatorial explosion at any or all levels, different iteration strategies (breadth-first, depth-first, selective), different formalisation targets (Lean, Coq, Isabelle, pen-and-paper), different stopping criteria.

  **The compendium must:**
  - Give this general methodology a NAME (covering the entire possibility space)
  - Define it formally (what the operations are, what the parameters are, what the space of possible instantiations is)
  - State that convergence and iterative convergence (as used by Gnosis) are specific instantiations
  - Claim provenance over the general framework via Bitcoin timestamp
  - Note: some sub-methods already named (convergence, iterative convergence) — the compendium EXPANDS to name the umbrella methodology encompassing all permutations

  This is important because anyone could later do "4-way convergence with Coq verification" or "convergence with different iteration strategy" — all of these fall under the methodology we are defining and timestamping here.

- **Honest limitations:** verification rate (what % of 256 succeeded?), which convergences could NOT be verified (and why), where Gnosis's cascade structure diverged from what formal proofs showed.
- **Reproducibility:** Tools are open source. Anyone can run Gnosis + Logos on their own domains.

**CLARIFYING NOTES (read these when starting the compendium):**

**Q: What's the difference between Steps 2a, 2b, and 2c?**
A: Step 2a = prove each convergence individually (256 separate proofs — the nodes). Step 2b = prove the cascade transitions (how groups of convergences converge to meta-findings — the edges, ~34 transition theorems). Step 2c = connect ALL nodes and edges into ONE single theorem (the Super-Theorem — the completed puzzle). Step 2a gives you puzzle pieces. Step 2b shows how they connect. Step 2c is the completed puzzle.

**Q: How do we know the structure for Steps 2b and 2c?**
A: Gnosis already mapped it. The cascade (266 → 26 → ~6 → 2) tells us which convergences relate to which meta-findings, which meta-findings converge further, etc. We're PROVING what Gnosis found, not rediscovering it. Top-down from known structure.

**Q: What if some convergences in Step 2a can't be verified?**
A: That's fine and expected. Record the verification rate honestly. Convergences that fail verification get noted in the methodology section. The Super-Theorem (Step 2c) uses only the verified subset. A 70% verification rate is itself a significant result — it means Gnosis is right 70% of the time, which is remarkable for autonomous AI discovery.

**Q: Is the Super-Theorem one Lean file?**
A: Probably not. It's likely one MATHEMATICAL theorem expressed across multiple Lean files (one per cascade level, plus a master file that ties them together). The point is that it's one THEOREM — one connected mathematical statement — even if the proof spans many files.

**Q: How does this feed into the Grand ToE Paper?**
A: The Super-Theorem (Step 2c) and its corollaries (Step 2d) become the core evidence section of the Grand ToE Paper. The Grand ToE synthesises Papers A-E + 22 capstone papers + the Compendium into one definitive paper. The Compendium provides the empirical backbone — 200+ verified cross-domain convergences unified into one reflexive structure.

**Q: The compendium validates methodologies — which ones exactly?**
A: Two novel methodologies we created, both validated by the compendium's success:

1. **Convergence methodology** — Autonomous pairwise structural comparison of independent mathematical/scientific fields. Gnosis AI compares Field A to Field B and identifies shared formal structure. If Step 2a verifies that these are real (not hallucinated) mathematical relationships, then convergence methodology is validated as a discovery method.

2. **Iterative convergence methodology** — Applying convergence analysis recursively to its OWN outputs. Take the convergences found in pass 1, treat them as objects, find convergences BETWEEN them (meta-convergences), repeat until fixed points. If Step 2b verifies that the cascade transitions are mathematically valid, then iterative convergence is validated as a methodology — i.e., the method of "converging the convergences" produces genuine higher-order mathematical structure, not artifacts.

Both are novel. Neither existed before this programme.

**Q: Discovery of WHAT exactly?**
A: Cross-domain structural unity. Specifically: that independent, established mathematical and scientific fields share formal structure that can be (a) autonomously identified, (b) formally stated, and (c) machine-verified. The compendium proves this is real. The deeper discovery — from iterative convergence — is that this shared structure ITSELF has structure: it cascades, contracts, and terminates at reflexive fixed points. That's not "finding theorems" — it's discovering that the relationships between fields form a coherent mathematical object with specific properties.

**The punchline:** The compendium doesn't just contain results. It proves the PROCESS. And its crown jewel — the Super-Theorem — is a single mathematical object that unifies 200+ verified cross-domain convergences into one reflexive structure, machine-verified, establishing the SRRP as a theorem rather than a hypothesis.

| # | Page | What It Covers |
|---|------|---------------|
| G1 | **Landing page** | Product pitch + version timeline (v1 → v2). What Gnosis IS, how it works, open source link, pip install. |
| G2 | **v1 results & impact page** | Show test run results (266 convergences, browsable). List everything v1 contributed to: Compendium data, Papers G16-G19, and any other papers that used test run outputs. "Here's what v1 did and where its outputs appear across the programme." |
| G3 | **v2 upgrades page** | All improvements over v1. Frame as: "v1 had these weaknesses → v2 addresses them with X, Y, Z." Honest: built, not yet deployed on full dataset. Stage B will use this. |

#### CROSS-LINKS (enforce during build)

- Gnosis wing ↔ Convergence Codex wing (tool ↔ results)
- Gnosis wing ↔ Logos wing (discovery ↔ formalisation)
- Wing 1 Gnosis papers → Gnosis wing (attribution)
- Convergence Codex wing → Gnosis wing + Logos wing ("how this was made")
- All version-explicit: wherever Gnosis outputs appear, state WHICH version produced them.

---

**PHASE 3: OPEN SOURCE + SHIP**

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 9 | **Open source Gnosis v2 + Logos AI** — PyPI packages, CLI entry points, config system, README with quickstart, example data, CI/CD, dual-mode backend (API + Max Plan). Goal: `pip install` and run on your own domains. | NOT DONE |
| 10 | QC all wings | NOT DONE |
| 11 | Deploy | NOT DONE |

---

**PHASE 4: OUTREACH**

| 12 | Kerygma AI or manual outreach | NOT DONE |

---

**PHASE 5: STAGE B (post-outreach, optional)**

Stage B is the full 81-field run across ALL of science, maths, physics. It strengthens evidence but doesn't change the theory. Decoupled from the main path — can happen after outreach, potentially with collaborators.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 13 | Stage B — full Codex across 81 fields (6 phases) with Gnosis v3 + Logos v2. $0 cost via MaxPlanAPI. | NOT DONE |
| 14 | Stage B capstone papers | NOT DONE |
| 15 | Stage B formalisation catalogue | NOT DONE |
| 16 | Update Codex wing with Stage B results | NOT DONE |

---

**Strategy notes (3 May 2026):**
- **Synthesis AI RETIRED.** All papers composed manually with Claude Code ($0, better quality). Code kept in repo for reference only.
- **MaxPlanAPI.** Both Gnosis and Logos support `--max-plan` flag ($0 via Claude Code CLI). Stage B can run entirely free.
- **Stages C, D, E (crown jewels, hardening, grand finale) COLLAPSED** into the single Grand ToE Paper (#7). One definitive paper instead of 3 separate stages.
- **22 capstone papers + Compendium = the Codex wing content.** No thin AI-generated papers.
- **Open source = Gnosis + Logos only.** Researchers run discovery + formalisation on their own domains.

---

#### BUILD PLAN: Kerygma AI — Automated Research Outreach (Stage 6a)

**"Kerygma"** (Greek: κήρυγμα, "proclamation") — the AI that proclaims our discoveries to the people who need to hear them.

**What it does:** Discovers relevant researchers, profiles them from their publications, matches our work to their interests, composes personalised correspondence, sends it, and tracks responses. Each email references the recipient's specific work and links to the exact relevant paper/finding from our body of work.

**Architecture (~1,000-1,200 lines):**
```
kerygma/
  __init__.py
  discovery.py        — Find researchers via Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, faculty pages
  profiler.py         — Build recipient profiles from their publications
  matcher.py          — Match our papers/findings to each recipient's interests
  composer.py         — Generate personalised emails via Claude (Max Plan, $0)
  sender.py           — Email delivery via SendGrid with rate limiting
  tracker.py          — Track sends, opens, replies, bounces
  compliance.py       — CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance, unsubscribe handling
  cli.py              — CLI interface
  config.py           — API keys, email settings, sending domain
  templates/
    base.html         — Email HTML template (clean, academic)
    plaintext.txt     — Plain text fallback
```

**The 6-Stage Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: Discovery** (~150 lines)
- Input: research topics, keywords, fields (e.g., "convergent evolution," "category theory," "mathematical physics")
- Sources: Semantic Scholar API (search by topic → get authors), OpenAlex (concepts → researchers), Google Scholar profiles (via scraping), conference speaker lists, university faculty pages
- Output: `Candidate` objects with name, institution, email, h-index, recent papers, research topics
- Target: 2,000-5,000 candidates → filtered to 500-1,000

**Stage 2: Profiling** (~150 lines)
- For each candidate, pull their 5 most recent + 5 most cited papers
- Extract: research focus areas, methodological approach, which of our domains they work in
- Classify: theorist vs experimentalist, senior vs early-career, which specific sub-topic
- Output: `RecipientProfile` with interest_tags, relevance_score, best_contact_angle

**Stage 3: Matching** (~200 lines)
- Cross-reference each recipient's profile against our 43+ papers and 266+ convergences
- For each recipient, identify: the 1-3 most relevant papers, the specific convergence that connects to their work, the exact finding that would interest them
- Rank by match quality — only send to people where we have a genuine, specific connection
- Output: `Match` objects with paper_ids, convergence_ids, hook_text (why this matters to THEM)

**Stage 4: Composition** (~200 lines)
- Use Claude (Max Plan, $0) to compose each email
- Prompt includes: recipient profile, their recent paper abstracts, our matched findings, the specific connection
- Structure: (1) Reference their work specifically, (2) The connection to our finding, (3) Link to the specific paper, (4) Clear, honest framing (AI-assisted discovery, open source, seeking feedback)
- Anti-spam: no hype, no sales language, genuine research correspondence tone
- Each email is unique — not a template with name swapped in

**Stage 5: Sending** (~150 lines)
- Email service: SendGrid (free tier: 100/day) or Amazon SES ($0.10 per 1,000)
- Rate limiting: start at 20/day, ramp to 100/day over 2 weeks (warm-up)
- Proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC on sending domain
- Unsubscribe link in every email (CAN-SPAM compliance)
- Bounce handling: auto-remove invalid addresses

**Stage 6: Tracking** (~100 lines)
- Track: sent, delivered, opened, replied, bounced, unsubscribed
- Dashboard: response rate by field, by match quality, by paper referenced
- Follow-up queue: people who opened but didn't reply → single polite follow-up after 7 days
- Export: CSV of all contacts for CRM or manual follow-up

**Tiered Quality:**

| Tier | Count | Quality | Review |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **1 (VIP)** | 50-100 | Hand-composed by Kerygma + reviewed by you before send | Dana Scott, key physicists, major labs |
| **2 (High)** | 200-500 | Fully automated, high match quality | Researchers whose work directly connects |
| **3 (Broad)** | 500-1000 | Lighter touch, still personalised | Broader field researchers |

**Example output (Tier 1):**
```
Subject: Structural convergence between [their field] and [our finding] — open source data

Dear Professor [Name],

Your 2024 paper on [specific paper title] identified [specific result] —
particularly the finding that [specific structural conclusion from their work].

We've been running an autonomous cross-domain analysis (Gnosis AI, open source)
across 52 scientific fields, and one of the strongest convergences we found
connects directly to your result: [specific convergence claim], supported by
independent findings from [domain pair]. The formal mathematical relationship
is detailed in our paper "[paper title]" (DOI: [zenodo DOI]).

All 266 convergences, 256 formal proofs, and the full cascade analysis are
available at [link]. The discovery tools are open source (MIT license).

We'd value your perspective — particularly on whether the [specific structural
claim] holds under [specific condition from their work].

Best regards,
Mark E. Mala

| `wonderben-code/infinitography-website` | Website (all wings including Codex + Pansophia) |

---

### Stage 3c: Pansophia Wing — NOT STARTED

**Now part of Phase 2 website work (see Stage 3b roadmap above).** Pansophia gets its own wing on infinitography.com.

**Paper:** "Pansophia: A Theoretical Architecture for Autonomous Knowledge Integration at Civilisational Scale"
**Zenodo:** https://zenodo.org/records/19974680 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.19974680)
**Bitcoin-stamped:** 2 May 2026 (in convergence-codex repo)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Paper written + published on Zenodo | DONE |
| Add `/pansophia` wing to infinitography.com | NOT DONE |
| Landing page: vision, architecture, what autonomous knowledge integration means | NOT DONE |
| Link to Zenodo paper + concept explanation | NOT DONE |
| Frame as future research direction: what happens when the full pipeline runs at civilisational scale | NOT DONE |

---

### Stage 3d: Remaining Infinitography Website — NOT STARTED

These should happen AFTER the Codex and Pansophia wings (so homepage, playtest, etc. can reference everything).

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Wing 2 (ToE) — built from proposal doc | DONE |
| Papers 1-4 rewrite | DONE |
| Homepage content update (Landing.tsx, including Codex references) | NOT DONE |
| Full website playtest (all wings including Codex + Pansophia) | NOT DONE |
| QC Pass all wings | NOT DONE |
| Paper 12 upgrade (Subsequent Advancements → Zenodo v2) | NOT DONE |

---

### Stage 4: Polish Both Projects — NOT STARTED

**AgentCiv:**
- 9 NotebookLM podcasts
- Disclaimers page
- Professional email (agentciv.ai)
- Homepage quote update
- Repo cleanup + consistent READMEs
- Copy audit (every claim verified)
- Add Infinitography section to agentciv.ai

**Infinitography/Gnosis:**
- Copy audit
- Repo cleanup
- File "Gnosis AI" trademark (Nice Class 9 + 42) — MUST be before outreach
- Website refinements

---

### Stage 5: QA/QC — Pre-Outreach Audit — NOT STARTED

**5A. Papers:**
- Final version sync (GitHub vs Zenodo vs arXiv)
- LaTeX formatting (all 34 papers — fixes Unicode in current PDFs)
- Re-upload to Zenodo as v2 (LaTeX PDFs)
- arXiv submission (all 34, needs Jack's endorsement)
- Cross-reference DOIs in paper text
- Zenodo metadata polish

**5B. Websites:**
- Science page upgrade (provenance section + per-paper links)
- Homepage credibility (arXiv + Zenodo logos)
- **CLARITY PASS — BOTH WEBSITES** (7 layers: jargon audit, 10-second test, sentence rewriting, assumed knowledge, consistent vocabulary, explanation hierarchy, every surface)
- Full 10-layer QA audit — AgentCiv
- Full 10-layer QA audit — Infinitography
- Disclaimers pages — both sites

**5B-extra. Software Playtest:**
- agentciv-creator: pip install → real campaigns
- agentciv-engine: pip install → all presets, Max Plan + API
- agentciv-sim: pip install → configs, chronicler
- **Convergence Codex AIs:** Basic playtest (does `python3 scripts/run_stage_a.py --help` work from clean clone?). Full production-grade packaging is Step 12 in the Convergence Codex roadmap.

**5C. Repo + Infrastructure:**
- ORCID populated with all DOIs
- OTS upgrade verification (all stamps finalized)
- Repo hygiene (remove internal docs from public repos)
- README quality pass

**5D. Decisions:**
- Colony + Gnosis repo visibility (public before outreach?)
- Paper 3 figures (references fig1-fig8 that don't exist)
- **Capstone AI framing** — public repo contains "Nobel-grade" language in prompts/code. QC must ensure this is framed properly: papers written in the FORMAT of landmark scientific papers (Einstein, Dirac, Higgs model — genuine claims about reality with precise scoping and falsifiable predictions), NOT "AI that wins Nobel Prizes." The quality standard is clear; the branding should be about the scientific rigour, not the prize.

**5E. Outreach Prep:**
- AgentCiv outreach email (full rewrite from v0.1)
- Infinitography outreach email (separate, philosophy/physics audience)
- AgentCiv target list (70+ people)
- Infinitography target list (200+ people, Dana Scott priority)

---

### Stage 6: Outreach (Kerygma AI) — NOT STARTED

**Kerygma AI** (Greek: "proclamation") — automated outreach system. Replaces manual 40-person email list with a system that discovers, profiles, matches, composes, and sends personalised research correspondence at scale. See BUILD PLAN below.

- **6a. Build Kerygma AI** — Discovery + Profiling + Matching + Composition + Sending + Tracking
- **6b. AgentCiv outreach** — AI researchers, MAS labs, frontier labs, 100+
- **6c. Infinitography/Gnosis outreach** — mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, 500+
- **6d. Combined narrative** — for people spanning both domains
- **6e. Scale run** — 1000+ personalised research correspondences
- **6f. Logistics** — deliverability, compliance, follow-ups, tracking

---

### Stage 7: Recursive Configuration Loop — NOT STARTED

- Build Engine ↔ Simulation self-improving loop
- Run experiments: does the loop converge?
- Update Papers 8+9 with empirical results → Zenodo v2
- Own wing on agentciv.ai

### Stage 8: The Colony — NOT STARTED
